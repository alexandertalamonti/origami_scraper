# Project 2 in PPDS
This is a web scraping project that retrieves the names of all available origami folds from this website https://www.origami-fun.com/origami-instructions.html and sorts the folds in alphabetical order with associated links. 

We accomplish this by creating an array that stores the names of the folds along with their respective links, provided the data exists and can be extracted.

## Purpose
+ Locate a specific fold quicker through easy navigation
+ Save time by reducing the need to manually visit the website

## Selected Website
The selected website is https://www.origami-fun.com/origami-instructions.html. This website contains minimal confidential information included, reducing the risk of violating terms of service or causing ethical concerns with web scraping. Additionally, the website's current interface can be challenging for users to navigate, so organizing the origami folds through web scraping could significantly improve usability.

## Steps 
+ Make sure Git and Python are installed
+ Clone the repository
+ Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
+ Run the code and view output results!
